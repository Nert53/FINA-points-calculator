# FINA points calculator
This was my final project on High school studies (programming class). The topic was "web application" and I choose to do FINA points calculator (https://www.fina.org/swimming/points). I used Python (because we were using it through all the programming lessons) with Flask and other web elements. I was also pursuing with open data, so for storing data I chose XML file (it has great modifiability and it is wide spread).

### To do (May 2023)
- [ ] new UI
- [ ] dark mode
- [ ] update XML file for current year
- [ ] public app
- [ ] make simple console app, that will allow me to edit the world records in XML (propably in C#)
