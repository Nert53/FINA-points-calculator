# FINA_points_calculator
Graduation project for programming

This was my final project on High school studies (programming lessons). The topic was "web application" and I choose to do FINA points calculator (https://www.fina.org/swimming/points). I used Python (because we were using it through all the programming lessons) with Flask and other web elements. I was also pursuing with open data, so for storing data I chose XML file (it has great modifiability and it is wide spread).
